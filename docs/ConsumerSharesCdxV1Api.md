Delete a Consumer Share

[![General Availability](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lifecycle%20Stage-General%20Availability-%2345c6e8)](#section/Versioning/API-Lifecycle-Policy)  Make a request to delete a consumer share.

### Example

* Basic Authentication (api-key):
```python
import time
import os
import openapi_client
from openapi_client.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://api.confluent.cloud
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = openapi_client.Configuration(
    host = "https://api.confluent.cloud"
)

# The client must configure the authentication and authorization parameters
# in accordance with the API server security policy.
# Examples for each auth method are provided below, use the example that
# satisfies your auth use case.

# Configure HTTP basic authorization: api-key
configuration = openapi_client.Configuration(
    username = os.environ["USERNAME"],
    password = os.environ["PASSWORD"]
)

# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with openapi_client.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = openapi_client.ConsumerSharesCdxV1Api(api_client)
    id = 'id_example' # str | The unique identifier for the consumer share.

    try:
